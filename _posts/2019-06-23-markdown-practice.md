>"_I have to learn Markdown, because it is necessary to create my blog, but before I start to tell you the secrets of Markdown step by step I would like to thank my coding master Pieter Frenssen. He was with me at the beginning, he believes in me and supports me every minute and every hour when I was stuck coding."_

I have started with my project to create my own blog as a portfolio, but I found that it is not easy to write. Hmm yes &mdash; so many ideas, the words were like a pearl necklace, but something was missing on that jewel and this is the proper arrangement of pearls and their selection. To create my first jewel &mdash; "my own blog" &mdash; I had to start with small and basic steps. In the following lines, I will tell you how to get started to format your text, to put pictures, to make paragraphs and all the basic things which we need. Let's put together the pearls on our necklace. 

The first simple exercise &mdash; or the first pearl &mdash; was how to make a phrase  _italic_ in Markdown. To find that you can surround words with underscore (\_) was easy because asking Google is the most easy things nowadays. Of course if you start to learn the basic elements in text formatting you need to know also how to make a phrase **bold**. Similarly, to make phrases **bold**, you can surround words with two asterisks (\**).

For example: to make words _italic_ and **bold** in Markdown, just underscore (\_word\_) it would become _word_ and for the bold surround with asterisks (\**word\**) word would become **word**.

We can use both italics and bold in the same line or to span them. Lets make some examples:

I am _writing a blog_ for my first step of **coding**.
I am writing a blog for **_my first step of coding_**.

And we can add also ~~strikethrough~~ using two tildes. Example: \~~Scratch this~~.
 
Every beginning is difficult but when you start you have to continue your path. Once you learn the first step how to write some text and format it, of course a problem will arise with the headers. Headers, headers, headers&hellip; yes if i continue to write the word headers six times it wouldn't be a mistake. There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes. To make headers in Markdown we need to use the hash mark (#). We need to place the same number of harsh marks as the size of the header we want. 

(\# Header one)  
# Header one
(\## Header two) 
## Header two
(\### Header three)
### Header three
(\#### Header four)
#### Header four
(\##### Header five)
##### Header five
(\###### Header six)
###### Header six

Ok. I am ready with my text, my formatting and have headers, but I want to make a link to another web site. Well there are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first is the inline link, to create it we wrap the link text in brackets ([ ]), and then we wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). As an example let's add a link of my "good friend" which helps me a lot:

[Search for it.](https://www.google.com) 

To make a link to www.google.com, with link text "Search for it." We have just to write: \[Search for it.](https://www.google.com). 

Of course if you know how to create links, you have to know how to create images. The syntax is almost the same. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point (!).

The first picture I took from my pictures folder. To create an image link, enter an exclamation point( ! ), wrap the alt text (a phrase or sentence that describe the image for the visually impaired) in brackets ([ ]), and then wrap the link in parenthesis ( (  ) ):  \![picture]\(/pictures/sunset_small.jpg).

![picture](/pictures/sunset_small.jpg)

The same way I use a picture that is published on the internet: \![Bewick's Wren]\(https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48103080941_47c32aa82c_z.jpg)

But writing text and formatting it is not easy without using blockquotes, using lists, and paragraphs.
To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the greater than caret (>). For example: "My first step of coding is very difficult." Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paraghraphs. The blockquotes can be nested. Then add >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
The list we create when we start each line with a hyphen or an asterisk, followed by a space. List items can be nested. Let's try:

* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
	* Bullet 1a
	* Bullet 2b
* Bullet 3


Or we may create a list by numbers. Start each line with a number and a period, than a space.

1. Numbered list 1
2. Numbered list 2
3. Numbered list 3

To finish the text we need to know how to formatting paragraphs in Markdown. To create paragraphs is easy, we use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

All pearls are selected and strung. We already have our first necklace.
